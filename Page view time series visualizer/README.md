# Page View Time Series Visualizer

#### Overview
The Time Series Data Visualization project involves analyzing and visualizing data from the freeCodeCamp forum page views. It explores trends, patterns, and seasonality in page views over time, utilizing line plots, bar plots, and box plots. The project aims to provide insights into the forum's traffic and engagement.

#### Significance
This project holds significance in several aspects:
1. **Data Visualization**: It demonstrates the importance of visualizing time series data to understand trends and patterns effectively.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The project involves cleaning the data by removing outliers, and ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
3. **Insights into Engagement**: By analyzing page views over time, insights can be gained into user engagement with the freeCodeCamp forum.
4. **Communication of Findings**: Visualizations are effective tools for communicating findings to stakeholders and decision-makers.

#### Insights
Through this project, various insights can be derived:
- **Overall Trend**: The line plot shows the overall trend in page views from May 2016 to December 2019, highlighting periods of high and low activity.
- **Seasonality**: The box plots display the seasonality of page views, with higher activity during certain months and lower activity during others.
- **Yearly Trends**: Year-wise box plots reveal trends and outliers, indicating changes in engagement over the years.
- **Monthly Patterns**: Bar plots show average page views per month, allowing identification of monthly patterns and trends.

#### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The project is implemented in Python, a versatile programming language.
- **Pandas**: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis, including cleaning and transforming data.
- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is used for creating visualizations, including line plots, bar plots, and box plots.
- **Seaborn**: Seaborn, a statistical data visualization library, is used to enhance the aesthetics of the plots.
- **Unit Testing**: The `unittest` library is employed to ensure the correctness of the visualizations and data cleaning process.

#### Conclusion
The Time Series Data Visualization project offers valuable insights into user engagement with the freeCodeCamp forum over a period of several years. By analyzing trends, patterns, and seasonality, it provides a comprehensive understanding of the forum's traffic. Moreover, the project demonstrates the importance of data visualization in extracting meaningful insights from time series data. Through effective communication of findings, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance user engagement and experience on the forum.
