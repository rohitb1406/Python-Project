# Sea Level Predictor

### Overview
The Sea Level Predictor project is designed to analyze and visualize historical sea level data and make predictions for future sea level rise. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Scipy, this project processes and visualizes data from the EPA's Global Mean Sea Level Data, providing insights into past trends and projecting potential future scenarios.

### Significance
Understanding the rise in sea levels is crucial for assessing climate change impacts and formulating adaptation strategies. By analyzing historical data and creating predictive models, this project helps researchers, policymakers, and the general public grasp the severity of rising sea levels and plan accordingly.

### Insights
- **Historical Trends**: The project provides insights into historical sea level trends, allowing us to see how sea levels have changed over time.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using linear regression, the project predicts future sea levels based on historical data, providing estimates of sea level rise for the coming decades.
- **Impact Awareness**: Through visualizations, the project raises awareness about the impact of climate change on sea levels and coastal communities.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing easy handling of large datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: Provides tools for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computing, used for array manipulation and mathematical operations.
- **Scipy**: Provides functions for scientific computing, including statistical analysis and linear regression.

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Import**: The project imports historical sea level data from a CSV file provided by the EPA.
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: The project creates a scatter plot of sea level data over time.
   - **Linear Regression**: It fits linear regression lines to the data, indicating the overall trend and rate of sea level rise.
3. **Insight Generation**:
   - **Historical Trends**: Insights into historical sea level changes and trends.
   - **Future Predictions**: Predictions of future sea level rise based on linear regression models.
4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests are performed to ensure the correctness of the plotted data and labels.
### Conclusion
The Sea Level Predictor project provides a comprehensive analysis of sea level data, offering valuable insights into past trends and future projections. It serves as a tool for raising awareness about the urgency of addressing climate change and its impact on sea levels.
