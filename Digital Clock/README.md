# Digital Clock using Python and Tkinter

#### Overview:
In this project, you will create a digital clock with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter. The digital clock will display the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)

#### Features:
1. **Digital Display:**
   - Implement a digital display to show the current time.
   - Display hours, minutes, and seconds.

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   - The clock should update in real-time, showing the current time accurately.

3. **Styling and Design:**
   - Customize the appearance of the digital clock.
   - Choose an appropriate font, size, and color for the text.

4. **Resizable Window:**
   - Create a resizable window that adjusts to the size of the digital clock.

5. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement basic user interaction, such as clicking on the window to exit the application.

#### Conclusion:
Building a digital clock using Python and Tkinter provides a practical introduction to GUI programming. This project allows you to enhance your skills in working with graphical interfaces while creating a useful and visually appealing application.
