### Project Title: Digital Clock using Python and Tkinter

### Project Description:

#### Overview:
In this project, you will create a digital clock with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter. The digital clock will display the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)

#### Features:
1. **Digital Display:**
   - Implement a digital display to show the current time.
   - Display hours, minutes, and seconds.

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   - The clock should update in real time, showing the current time accurately.

3. **Styling and Design:**
   - Customize the appearance of the digital clock.
   - Choose an appropriate font, size, and color for the text.

4. **Resizable Window:**
   - Create a resizable window that adjusts to the size of the digital clock.

5. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement basic user interaction, such as clicking on the window to exit the application.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Setting Up the GUI:**
   - Import the necessary libraries (e.g., `tkinter`, `time`).
   - Create the main application window.

2. **Designing the Digital Clock:**
   - Create a label widget to display the time.
   - Customize the label's appearance (font, size, color).

3. **Updating Time:**
   - Use the `time` module to get the current time.
   - Update the label's text with the current time.

4. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Implement a function to update the time at regular intervals (e.g., every second).

5. **Styling and Design:**
   - Experiment with different font styles, sizes, and colors to enhance the visual appeal of the digital clock.

6. **Resizable Window:**
   - Allow the window to be resized while maintaining the proper display of the digital clock.

7. **User Interaction:**
   - Add an event listener to handle user interactions (e.g., closing the window when clicked).

#### Additional Challenges (Optional):

- Implement a feature to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
- Add a background color or image to the window for a more aesthetically pleasing design.
- Explore incorporating alarm functionality with sound notifications.

#### Conclusion:
Building a digital clock using Python and Tkinter provides a practical introduction to GUI programming. This project allows you to enhance your skills in working with graphical interfaces while creating a useful and visually appealing application.
